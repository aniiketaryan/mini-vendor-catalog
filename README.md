## Common Errors and Fixes
- **repo not found**: Make sure you created the repo, and remote URL matches your GitHub.
- **src refspec main does not match any**: Make your first commit before pushing (`git add .; git commit -m "init"`).
- **Command not found (npm, npx, git)**: Install Node.js + git from official sites.
- **Database errors**: Check MongoDB Atlas connection string, user rights, and IP whitelist.
- **CORS errors**: Ensure `app.use(cors())` is in the backend server.js.
- **Frontend can't reach backend**: Make sure both are running locally, and `.env` points to correct port.
